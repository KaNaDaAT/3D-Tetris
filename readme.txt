## Claim

The tasks T1, T3, T5 have been fully implemented. Extra Credit B1 has been fully implemented.

Maybe also B3 when the "animation" after destroying rows count.

The task T2 has not been fully done because of time issues but as one can see in the main.js its fairly simple to add them (wait for Scene Files :D).

## Tested Environments

Local in **Brave**-Browser running on an python http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
Tested on almighty with same browser as well

## Additional Remarks

Not much as it would be to complex to talk about everything. But nice features:

- Add `?width=4&height=10&depth=4` in your browser to decide what sice the grid should be.
